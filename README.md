## Starting the frontend

`npm start` will start the frontend in development mode. This will open a browser window with a QR code. You can scan this with your phone to open the app in the Expo Go app, or you can follow the terminal instructions to open the app in a simulator.
`npm run ios` will open the a QR code for iOS devices and open the app in an iOS simulator.
`npm run android` will open the a QR code for Android devices and open the app in an Android simulator.

## Setting up your React Native (frontend) development environment

This React Native app was created using the [Expo CLI](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup). I have seen documentation suggesting you need to install it globally using `npm install -g expo-cli`, but have also seen suggestions this is deprecated so suggest you only run that if a need arises. As React Native is already set up, cloning the repo, `cd`ing into the `frontend` and running `npm install` should be all you need to do to set up `expo-cli`.

To view the app in iOS using a simulator or on an iphone you will need to install Xcode (and the Expo Go app for iPhone). Please see the [Xcode](./documentation/xcode.md) page for more information.

To view the app in Android using a simulator or on an Android phone you will need to install Android Studio (and the Expo Go app for Android). Please see the [Android Studio](./documentation/android_studio.md) page for more information.
