# Aura

Blah blah blah... placeholder for introductory text.

## Setting up your development environment

This React Native app was created using the [Expo CLI](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup). I have seen documentation suggesting you need to install it globally using `npm install -g expo-cli`, but have also seen suggestions this is deprecated so suggest you only run that if a need arises. As the Aura project is already set up, cloning it and running `npm install` should be all you need to do.

To view the app in iOS using a simulator or on an iphone you will need to install Xcode (and the Expo Go app for iPhone). Please see the [Xcode](./documentation/xcode.md) page for more information.

To view the app in Android using a simulator or on an Android phone you will need to install Android Studio (and the Expo Go app for Android). Please see the [Android Studio](./documentation/android_studio.md) page for more information.
