# Best practices

# File Structure

1. File structure - individual component folders

</p>

## Stylesheet

The stylesheet should be located in-folder as default and a global file with colour variables.

# Naming convention

## Component folders and files 📁 📄

Component folders and their files should be named according to what they do/are, and using the PascalCase notation, e.g. `FacilityForm`.

## Non-component JavaScript files 📄

Non-component JavaScript files should be named according to what they do/are, and using the camelCase notation, e.g. `cafeController.js`.

## All other folders and files 📁 📄
Including all non-component directories and non-JavaScript files. This includes markdown and image files.

✅ Use kebab-case - lowercase and hyphens as delimiters.

❌ Don’t use spaces or underscores. Spaces are converted to %20 in URLs or can break an URL when shared. Underscores are difficult to see when the file name is displayed as an underlined link.

<!-- I removed the section below as it is covered in the above and I think it is worth having a proper overview of the overall file structure (coming soon) which will just further the repetition -->

<!-- ## Project tree folders 📁

These are the main folders in the repo, like `backend, frontend, src, public, routes, utils`, etc. Use kebab-case (words in use lowercase separated by dashes) as some file systems are case-insensitive (MacOS, Windows). -->

<!-- ## Markdown files

Use kebab-case (words in use lowercase separated by dashes), apart from the README file.

## Git branches

Name branches in all lowercase, with the following three elements separated by a forward slash:
* Your initials (including collaborators).
* The task type, e.g. feat, fix, doc, design, test.
* The task separated by hyphens.

Examples:

```
👉 jn/test/api-cafe-route

👉 lsjn/doc/readme-best-practices
```

# Commit Messages

Write your commit message [in the imperative](https://gist.github.com/robertpainsi/b632364184e70900af4ab688decf6f53): "Fix bug" and not "Fixed
bug" or "Fixes bug." This convention matches up with commit messages
generated by commands like git merge and git revert.

```
👉 Add CPU arch filter scheduler support

👉 Fix bug that was duplicating icons
```

ℹ️ More examples [here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

# Pull requests

If your PR is not ready for review yet, create it as a Draft PR and add the label “draft PR” to it.

PR names should use the conventional commit tags (feat, fix, doc, design, test). Example:

```
👉 test(backend): user login auth

👉 feat(frontend): add user avatar
```

# Components

Components should be named in Pascal case according to what they do/are

File structure - Each component should have its own directory containing:
* The component file, e.g. `FacilityForm.js`
* A styleSheet file (if needed), e.g. `FacilityFormStyles.js`
* A test file (to be created only when testing starts), e.g. `FacilityForm.test.js`

StyleSheet location - As a separate file as default but it is more practical to keep the styleSheet in the component file for small components, e.g. MenuBar.js.

Always use `globalStyleVariables.js` for colours where possible (in the `styles` directory).

# Testing 🧪

## Frontend

We use Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration tests.

## Backend

We use Vitest for unit and integration tests and Postman test for API endpoints.

## E2E Tests

We use Puppeteer for end-to-end tests.

# \***\*Prettier conflicts\*\***

Always check if your PR has reformatting changes. We use:

- `" "` double quotation marks instead of `' '` single quotation marks
