# File Structure

</p>

## Stylesheet

The stylesheet should be located in-folder as default and a global file with colour variables.

# Naming convention

✅ Use lowercase and dashes as delimiters (kebab-case)

❌ Don’t use spaces or underscores. Spaces are converted to %20 in URLs or can break an URL when shared. Underscores are difficult to see when the file name is displayed as an underlined link.

## Project tree folders 📁

These are the main folders in the repo, like `backend, frontend, src, public, routes, utils`, etc. Use kebab-case (words in use lowercase separated by dashes) as some file systems are case-insensitive (MacOS, Windows).

## Component folders 📁

Component folders and their files should be named according to what they do/are, and using the PascalCase notation. E.g. `

## Markdown files

Use kebab-case (words in use lowercase separated by dashes), apart from the README file.

# New branch in VS Code

Name the branch according to your task: all lowercase, add a commit tag (feat, fix, doc, design, test), and add the task separated by hyphens.

Examples:

```
👉 test/api-search-route

👉 doc/readme-best-practices
```

# Commit Messages

Write your commit message [in the imperative](https://gist.github.com/robertpainsi/b632364184e70900af4ab688decf6f53): "Fix bug" and not "Fixed
bug" or "Fixes bug." This convention matches up with commit messages
generated by commands like git merge and git revert.

```
👉 Add CPU arch filter scheduler support

👉 Fix bug that was duplicating icons
```

ℹ️ More examples [here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

# Pull requests

If your PR is not ready for review yet, create it as a Draft PR and add the label “Status: do not merge” to it.

PR names should use the conventional commit tags (feat, fix, doc, design, test). Example:

```
👉 test(backend): user login auth

👉 feat(frontend): add user avatar
```

# Components

components should be named according to what they do/are

file structure - individual component folders

stylesheet location - in-folder as default, global file with colours variables

# Testing 🧪

We use Vitest for unit tests and Postman test for endpoints.

# \***\*Prettier conflicts\*\***

Always check if your PR has reformatting changes. We use:

- `" "` double quotation marks instead of `' '` single quotation marks

# VSCode Extensions
